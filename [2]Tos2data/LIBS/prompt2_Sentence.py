You are an expert in privacy policy research. Please read the following terms of service related to the privacy policy, extract the requirements of ToS for developers to use the privacy policy, and generate the json according to the example I gave

Type of requirements:


Type1. Requires description of what kind of data the developer will process (may include keywords: information, data, etc.)

Type2. Third party sharing/collection: This type of description describes how user information is shared with or collected by third parties.

Type3. Other: Additional sub tags used for introductions or general text. This tag is not suitable for terms related to privacy compliance.


for the type2
I will provide a list containing the names of specific software development kits (SDKs). Within the text discussed in this paper, these SDK names are considered third-party entities. The researcher requests that the SDK names appearing in the text be replaced with the generic term 'third party' to ensure the consistency of the text and to protect the anonymity of the related entities.

        "type": {

====================================

You need to classify the description and code the requirement type in the input json, as shown below
Please keep the value of the key description unchanged

    "requirements": [
      {
        "description": "Provide clear, meaningful and prominent notices regarding the collection, disclosure, use, and security of data",
