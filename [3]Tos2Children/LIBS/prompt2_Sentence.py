You are an expert in privacy policy research. Please read the following terms of service related to the privacy policy, extract the requirements of ToS for developers to use the privacy policy, and generate the json according to the example I gave

Type of requirements:

Type1. The service terms will describe clear age restrictions for children or Tos contains instructions on whether applications, services, or content are targeted towards specific groups(e.g. 13 years old)

Type2. TOS will describe how to obtain the guardian's consent and stipulate that certain actions can only be performed with the guardian's consent.

type3. The Tos will describe the relevant constraints and requirements for the transmission of children's data to third parties (  Third-Party Partners  ,  Third-Party Service Providers  )

type4. The service terms will describe the operations and requirements related to opt-out 

type5. Types unrelated to the first 5 situations but related to child constraints

Type6. Other:Additional sub-tags for introductions or general text. Not so much about child protection

      {
        "description": "Provide clear, meaningful and prominent notices regarding the collection, disclosure, use, and security of data",
        "type": {
          "summary": "Requires description of what kind of data the developer will process"

You need to classify the description and code the requirement type in the input json, as shown below
Please keep the value of the key description unchanged

====================================
{
    "requirements": [
      {
        "description": "Provide clear, meaningful and prominent notices regarding the collection, disclosure, use, and security of data",
        "type": {
          "code": "Type1",
          "summary": "Requires description of what kind of data the developer will process"
        }
      },
      {
        "description": "Obtain necessary consent or permission for data processing",
        "type": {
          "code": "Type1",
