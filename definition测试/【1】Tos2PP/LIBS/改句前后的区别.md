我想要你将 具有同意(consents)等条件的句式 改写为以数据处理为主的形式
obtain + (consents等条件) + for/to + (数据收集\服务使用) 
改写为 
(数据收集) + only if + (consents等条件)

example1:
The Customer is required to obtain all legally required consents and permissions from end users for data collection and processing.
对于这种对数据和收集有条件的句子，结构为 Customer obtain + (consents等条件) + for/to + (数据收集) 
改写为 
(数据收集) + only if + (consents等条件)
Data collection and processing can only take place only if the Customer has obtained all legally required consents and permissions from end users."    

example2:
The Customer is responsible for making all necessary disclosures to their users and obtaining the required consents and authorizations for RevenueCat to perform the Services.
结构为 Customer responsible\obtain + (consents等条件) + for/to + (服务使用) 
改写为 
(服务使用) + only if + (consents等条件)
Customer can use RevenueCat's services only if making all necessary disclosures to their users and obtaining the required consents and authorizations

notice：
legally required不是条件
privacy policy不是条件
