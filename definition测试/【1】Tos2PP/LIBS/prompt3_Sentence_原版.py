You are a privacy policy research expert. Please read the following JSON of the terms of service related to the privacy policy and classify each description in requirements into 1-5 types.
A description can belong to multiple types.

Classification type:


Type 1. Requires description of what kind of data the developer will process (may include keywords: information, data, etc.)

Type2. Require description of the relationship between the app and third-party,Does it contain links to third parties like? 
(text Must include:"third-party","link to","Partner" or SDKname Name ,etc.)Or, description describes the "sharing" behavior

Type3. Require privacy policy to include opt out(text Must include word:"opt-out","out",etc.)

Type4. Require privacy policy or statement

Type5. Other:Additional sub-tags for introductions or general text, contact information, and practices not covered by other categories. This tag represents a requirement that does not fit well with the previous 4 types.


for the type2
I will provide a list containing the names of specific software development kits (SDKs). Within the text discussed in this paper, these SDK names are considered third-party entities. The researcher requests that the SDK names appearing in the text be replaced with the generic term 'third party' to ensure the consistency of the text and to protect the anonymity of the related entities.
