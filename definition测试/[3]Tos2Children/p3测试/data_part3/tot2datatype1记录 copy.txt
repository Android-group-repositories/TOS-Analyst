加例子

方式方法?不尊从我这搞

your app {cannot} {store} {personal health data}; {user}; Even obtain user consent


数据收集在目的上的
Customers are not allowed to configure the services or developer tools to enable the collection, transmission, or storage of restricted data through the services.
your app {cannot} {configure service} ; {user:customers} ; Even obtain user consent


出现了 condition在目的上

#pattern3# your app {can} {use service data}  ; when {for internal business purposes}




拿给type4

发现一个改句的例子，不改句不会把except后面的当条件
Description: No sensitive personal information should be used with the service, except as permitted under section 4.5 (Protected Health Information).
#pattern3# your app {cannot} {use sensitive personal information with sdk-service} ; {user:all users} ; Even obtain user consent

改句后
Description: Sensitive personal information should be used with the service only if permitted under section 4.5 (Protected Health Information).
#pattern4# your app {can} {use sensitive personal information with sdk-service} ; {user:all users} ; when {permitted under section 4.5 (Protected Health Information)}
