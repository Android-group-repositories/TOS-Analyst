Introduction.
PayPal Developer Platform. The PayPal Developer Platform is a global payments platform open to Developers. Our Developer's Tools offer you the ability to build Applications that interact with PayPal. Our goal is to encourage innovation, creativity and greater use of PayPal Services. Your use of PayPal Services, excluding Developer Tools and related products and services, in connection with your PayPal Account is covered by the User Agreement, as may be amended from time to time, or a separate written agreement between you and PayPal.
PayPal Developers. We consider you to be a Developer if you access or use the Developer's Tools for any purpose including building an Application and making an API Call, irrespective of whether your use is for your own benefit or as a third party service provider. All Developers and API Callers are jointly and severally subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Developers must have a PayPal Account in good standing.
App ID and API Credentials. PayPal will provide you a unique confidential identification code, certificate and App ID that enable you to use the Developer's Tools. PayPal may also provide you with API Credentials for testing and production. PayPal may immediately terminate or revoke your App ID and API Credentials for any reason in PayPal's sole discretion. You may not sell, transfer, sublicense, or disclose your App ID, API Credentials or other PayPal Account credentials to any third party, other than a service provider performing services on your behalf, and you agree to notify PayPal immediately of any violation of your obligations in this sentence. If you sell or otherwise transfer your Application, or permit an API Caller to operate it, PayPal agrees to issue a new App ID to the API Caller operating your Application. The API Caller is accountable for any personal data PayPal is instructed to transfer to it. You are liable for all activities performed with your App ID, API Credentials or other PayPal Account credentials.
The Sandbox, The Developer's Testing Environment.
Access. As a Developer, you may test your API Calls in the PayPal Sandbox, available through website_url_lnk and website_url_lnk When testing in the Sandbox, you may only use anonymous, non-live data.
Usage. You agree that all use of the Sandbox will be in accordance with PayPal's usage policies for Developer's Tools which are subject to change from time to time. PayPal may post on the Developer site and Developer blog, and send an email to you with notices of any changes. You agree that PayPal will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or cessation of Developer's Tools, including the Sandbox. All accounts and transactions made in the Sandbox are not real and no real money is transferred. The Sandbox is provided to you on an "as-is" basis and PayPal does not guarantee up-time or availability. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider, or other automatic device to create PayPal accounts for Sandbox use and you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure.
Live Access.
Your Application will be given Live Access if the following requirements are met: Business Account. The API Caller of the Application has a PayPal Business Account in good standing. You agree to provide information about you, the Business Account holder and the business owner to PayPal before receiving live credentials.
Your Application will be given Live Access if the following requirements are met: Application Approval. In certain instances, Your Application must receive prior approval from PayPal. You must complete our online questionnaire and submit any information we request so we can review your Application. All approval decisions will be made in PayPal's sole discretion. Decisions are based on factors including but not limited to whether the Application functions in accordance with your representations, complies with the PayPal Developer rules as stated in Sections 4 through 8 and Section 10 of this Agreement, is consistent with the PayPal Agreements and is not likely to prove harmful to PayPal, PayPal Users or the PayPal community.
APIs.
Support. PayPal may provide you with support or modifications for the Developer's Tools (collectively, "Support") in its sole discretion. PayPal may terminate such Support at any time without notice to you. PayPal may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Developer's Tools, at any time, including the availability of any PayPal APIs. PayPal may release subsequent versions of APIs, and you may be required to use those subsequent versions. PayPal may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts of or all of the Developer's Tools without notice or liability.
API Caller Certification. If you are accessing an advanced level API or more advanced features of a standard level API, you may be required to receive API Caller Certification before you are given Live Access. We may request, and you agree to provide, additional information in connection with API Caller Certification and any periodic reviews of your API Caller Certification that we may perform from time to time. PayPal does not guarantee that you will receive the API Caller Certification for your desired access level, and PayPal may revoke API Caller Certification at any time after notice to the API Caller. API Caller Certification is not required for standard level API Calls.
An advanced level API is an API and features of an API that PayPal has identified as having a higher level risk to PayPal and PayPal Users.
A standard level API is an API and features of an API that PayPal has identified as having a low risk to PayPal and PayPal Users.

You may not selectively decide to offer PayPal for some transactions but not for other transactions. If your Application or website supports PayPal Business Payments as well as standard PayPal payments, you may selectively choose which PayPal payment type you wish to offer in each transaction flow, provided only one type of PayPal payment method is offered in every flow.

For example, if you charge a fee to accept PayPal transactions but not to accept cash transactions and another payment option, then you are charging a surcharge. You may, however, charge Your Users a fee for the value added services that you provide so long as you charge such fee consistently for such value added services (for example, you can charge a fee for offering a new payment channel but all payments using that channel must be assessed the fee). In the event you apply a surcharge, you must inform the Buyer of the requested charge; PayPal has no liability to any Buyer where you have failed to inform the Buyer of any surcharge and you agree that any such liability shall be yours.

Where a payment is sent for forwarding or allocation to multiple Recipients, and the Seller has not paid the required fee, the Recipients must pay the fee in proportion to the amount of the payment received by each. If your Application requires the Sender to pay a fee, your Application must first obtain the Sender's Express Consent to payment of the fee.

Seller of Record Requirement. For every Purchase Payment, the Seller of the underlying sale must receive all or at least a substantial part of the Purchase Payment.
Availability of Funds. PayPal has no obligation to ensure that funds can be obtained from any Sender to cover a payment to be sent. If your Application chains payments from one Recipient to another, the sending of the payment to the second Recipient is subject to PayPal's ability to obtain funds from the first Recipient to cover the successive payment.
PayPal Business Payments. PayPal Business Payments cannot be offered in any payment flow where the standard PayPal payment is also offered. You must clearly and conspicuously disclose that PayPal Business Payments can only be funded using PayPal Balance or eCheck Payment Methods only.
